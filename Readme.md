# Four Function Calculator 

This repositry contains the code for a basic 4 function calculator capable of preforming operations on 2 numbers 
that additionally changes colors using the JSwing class.

## How It Works
The calculator has a string stored as the firstNumber that String valued numbers get added to until an operator 
is clicked which it then converts the string into a number. Same code goes with the secondNumber until the equal 
button is clicked; it then operates on the two intergers as indicated by the operator selected.
